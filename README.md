# Genetic-Programming-Toolbox
Conventional Genetic Programming framework combined with a variety of novel variation operators including "Nearby Neighbors of Semantic Subsets under P" and variation with the Semantically Aware Variational Autoencoder.

Tensor-based GP framework that enables convenient conversion between tree representations and model-based (DL) approaches.
The models folder contains the variation operators (explicit and model-based), each of which implements a 'variation' method that allows easy implementation within a conventional GP algorithm such as the one found in evolution.py.
## Usage
TBA in the near future along with config files
